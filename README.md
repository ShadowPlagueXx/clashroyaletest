# Clash Royale Experiment!
A small project to see how good the top players are in each country

I've integrated the .ipynb processes into a python file to run using your own IDLE!
All you need is your own API from developer.clashroyale.com and it's really easy to sign up

The files you need is the .py (of course), and the geojson file.
The program will generate a html document which will be the map, and a .txt file to store the sum of top trophies so you don't have to do it again.

Give me feedback on my first project!
